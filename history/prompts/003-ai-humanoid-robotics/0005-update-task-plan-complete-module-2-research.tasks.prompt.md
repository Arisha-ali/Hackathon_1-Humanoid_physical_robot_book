## Prompt

System: Please continue.

## Response snapshot

I have completed the initial research for Module 2, synthesized the key points, and stored them in `specs/003-ai-humanoid-robotics/research-module-2.md`. I have also updated the task list to reflect this progress.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Completed the first two tasks of Phase 2, laying the groundwork for the next steps.
- 🧪 Tests: No tests were run.
- 📁 Files: `specs/003-ai-humanoid-robotics/tasks.md` was modified. `specs/003-ai-humanoid-robotics/research-module-2.md` was created.
- 🔁 Next prompts: Proceed with task 2.3: Gather Module 3 sources (Isaac Sim, VSLAM, Nav2).
- 🧠 Reflection: The project is progressing well. The phased approach is helping to keep the work organized.

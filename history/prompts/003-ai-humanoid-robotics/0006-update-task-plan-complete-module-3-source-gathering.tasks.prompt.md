## Prompt

System: Please continue.

## Response snapshot

I have completed the initial source gathering for Module 3 and stored the research in `specs/003-ai-humanoid-robotics/research-module-3.md`, along with clarifying questions for the user. I have also updated the task list to reflect this progress.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Completed task 2.3 of Phase 2, identifying key areas for further user input to refine research.
- 🧪 Tests: No tests were run.
- 📁 Files: `specs/003-ai-humanoid-robotics/tasks.md` was modified. `specs/003-ai-humanoid-robotics/research-module-3.md` was created.
- 🔁 Next prompts: The user needs to provide more specific details on their goals for NVIDIA Isaac Sim, VSLAM, and ROS Nav2 to proceed with deeper research (Task 2.4: Organize research for Module 3).
- 🧠 Reflection: The need for clarification on broad topics highlights the importance of user interaction in the research phase.
